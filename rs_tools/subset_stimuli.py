subset_stimuli — Select a subset of stimuli from a stimulus list, by index, name, or regex.

This is the format-agnostic core of the stimulus filtering feature (JV, meeting
2026-09-23). It only knows about a plain list of stimulus names -- it has no
idea whether those names came from a choice file (`stim_list`) or a
coordinate file (`stim_labels`). The choice-file and coordinate-file specific
logic (renumbering trials, selecting matching rows in dimN arrays, etc.) is
built on top of this as separate wrappers, so both file types share one
selection implementation instead of two.
